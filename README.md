  ## Description:
 The objective of this application is to create a README Generator. The user may quickly create a professional README for a new project using command line inputs. The below criteria was kept in mind when creating this application:

 GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
 WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
 THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
 WHEN I enter my project title
 THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
 WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
 THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
 WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
 THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
 WHEN I enter my GitHub username
 THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
 WHEN I enter my email address
 THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
 WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
 THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

  ## Installation:
 The JavaScript code can be downloaded via the ReadMe Generator folder on my Github page.

  ## Usage:
  This ReadMe Generator is intended for easy viewing and navigation. The user begins by typing 'node index.js' in the command line. The prompts are intuitive and user inputs from the command line will be put into a ReadMe file.
